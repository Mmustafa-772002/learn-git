## Introduction
Git is a distributed version control system that allows multiple people to work on a project simultaneously without overwriting each other's changes. It is widely used in software development for tracking changes in source code during software development.
This repository aims to provide a hands-on approach to learning Git through practical examples and exercises.
## Getting Started
To get started with this repository, you will need to have Git installed on your machine. You
    can download Git from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/).      
Once Git is installed, you can clone this repository using the following command:
```bash                         
git clone https://github.com/your-username/learn-git.git
```
Navigate to the cloned directory:
```bash
cd learn-git
```
You are now ready to start learning and practicing Git commands!
## Basic Git Commands
This section covers the fundamental Git commands that you will use frequently.
- `git init`: Initialize a new Git repository.
- `git clone`: Clone an existing repository.
- `git add`: Stage changes for the next commit.
- `git commit`: Commit staged changes to the repository.
- `git status`: Check the status of your working directory and staging area.
- `git log`: View the commit history.
- `git diff`: Show changes between commits, commit and working tree, etc.
## Branching and Merging
Branching is a powerful feature in Git that allows you to create separate lines of development. This
section covers branching and merging concepts.
- `git branch`: List, create, or delete branches.
- `git checkout`: Switch to a different branch.     
- `git merge`: Merge changes from one branch into another.
- `git rebase`: Reapply commits on top of another base tip.
- `git stash`: Temporarily save changes that are not ready to be committed.
## Collaboration    
Git is designed for collaboration, allowing multiple developers to work on the same project. This section covers collaboration workflows.
- `git remote`: Manage remote repositories.
- `git fetch`: Download objects and refs from another repository.
- `git pull`: Fetch from and integrate with another repository or a local branch.
- `git push`: Update remote refs along with associated objects.
- `git fork`: Create a personal copy of someone else's repository.
## Advanced Git Commands
This section covers some advanced Git commands and techniques for more experienced users.
- `git cherry-pick`: Apply the changes introduced by some existing commits.
- `git bisect`: Use binary search to find the commit that introduced a bug. 
- `git reflog`: Show the history of changes to the tip of branches and other references.
- `git submodule`: Manage external repositories within a Git repository.
- `git filter-branch`: Rewrite branches.
